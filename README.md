TinderBot
=========
Well I thought that it might be fun to learn how API's work.
So I chose Tinder.

To use this:
 - Upload to a webserver with PHP and cURL enabled.
 - Go to: http://yoururl/?token=
   - token = your facebook token
 - If you like to automatically like everything change $autoLike = false; to true.
